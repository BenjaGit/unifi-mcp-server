## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-25

### 🔧 Critical Bug Fix - Topology Tools

Fixed topology tools that were completely non-functional due to using non-existent API endpoints.

### Fixed

- **Topology Tools (5 tools)**: Rewrote all topology tools to use correct Integration API endpoints
  - Changed from non-existent `/api/s/{site}/stat/topology` to proper Integration API endpoints
  - Now uses `/v1/sites/{siteId}/devices` and `/v1/sites/{siteId}/clients`
  - Updated data model field names to match Integration API response format
  - Fixed endpoint path construction using `get_integration_path()` for proper API translation
  - Added pagination support for large device/client lists
  - Fixed network depth calculation and client connection type detection

### Added

- **Integration Test Framework**: Comprehensive test harness for real-world validation
  - Multi-environment support (6 environments: 2 local + 4 cloud)
  - API mode testing (local, cloud-v1, cloud-ea)
  - Intelligent test skipping for unsupported API features
  - Detailed reporting with pass/fail/skip statistics
  - JSON export for CI/CD integration
  - Dry-run mode for test planning
  - Test suite organization with setup/teardown hooks
- **Topology Test Suite**: 8 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate on local APIs
- **Test Documentation**: Complete guide for writing and running integration tests

### Technical Details

**Data Model Changes**:

- `device._id` → `device.id`
- `device.mac` → `device.macAddress`
- `device.ip` → `device.ipAddress`
- `uplink.device_id` → `uplink.deviceId`
- `device.state` (int) → `device.state` (string: "CONNECTED"|other)

**Test Results**:

- 16/16 tests PASSED on local APIs (100%)
- 32/32 tests SKIPPED on cloud APIs (expected - topology not supported)
- 0 FAILED
- Total test duration: 6.97s across 6 environments

**API Limitations Documented**:

- Local APIs: Full topology support
- Cloud APIs (v1 & EA): Aggregate statistics only, no device-level data
